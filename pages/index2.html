      <h1><b>Number of Threats, Kidnappings, and Homicides in Colombia (1984-2015)</b></h1>
      <p>The following graphs show data for three different types of crimes commited in Colombia from 1984-2015, and shows the total amount for each gender in the data set: female, male, and LGBTI. They are charts are grouped thematically and separted by gender to comparison.<br></p>
      <p style="font-size: 11px">** The author is well aware that 1) the graphs would be better compared if laid side by side; 2) the length of the maxium value for each graph is the same length. He has not figured out how to adjust the bars to be relative with one another, nor how to paste them on the same page without overlaying an image; 3) 21-60 years and 61-100 years is a large age-range and therefore skews the data - In a future iteration, the author also hopes to fix these issues and plot the change in number of crimes commited by year for each gender. **</p>
